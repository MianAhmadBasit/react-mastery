component Lifecycle
Class vs Funcation
useEffect Hook
Localstorage side effect



=======================
React Component Life cycle
1 = Mount (component created & added to dom)
2 = Updated (component is updated in the Dom Trigger when state or props changed)
3 = UnMount (when Component is removed from Dom Meaning its no longer render )

=====
why should we care 
Run Code at the Right time (e.g fetch data ,  run timer etc)
Avoid bugs caused by unnecessary re-renders or memory leaks
Build More efficient applications
